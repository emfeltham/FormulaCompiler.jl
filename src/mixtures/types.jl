"""
    CategoricalMixture{T}

Represents a mixture of categorical levels with associated weights for statistical analysis.
Used to specify population composition scenarios and marginal effects computation.

# Fields
- `levels::Vector{T}`: Categorical levels (strings, symbols, booleans, or other types)
- `weights::Vector{Float64}`: Associated weights (must sum to 1.0)

# Example
```julia
# Educational composition mixture
edu_mix = CategoricalMixture(["high_school", "college"], [0.6, 0.4])

# Using the convenient mix() constructor
treatment_mix = mix("control" => 0.4, "treatment" => 0.6)
boolean_mix = mix(false => 0.3, true => 0.7)
```

# Validation
- Levels and weights must have the same length
- All weights must be non-negative
- Weights must sum to 1.0 (within tolerance)
- Levels must be unique

# Integration with FormulaCompiler
CategoricalMixture objects are automatically detected by FormulaCompiler's compilation
system and compiled into efficient zero-allocation evaluators using MixtureContrastOp.

"""
    MixtureWithLevels{T}

Wrapper that includes original categorical levels with the mixture for FormulaCompiler processing.
This type provides proper type-safe access to mixture components for the compilation system.

# Fields
- `mixture::CategoricalMixture{T}`: The core mixture specification
- `original_levels::Vector{String}`: Original levels from the data column

# Usage
This type is used internally by FormulaCompiler's scenario system to provide type-safe 
mixture processing with access to both mixture specifications and original data structure.

```julia
# Usually created automatically by FormulaCompiler's scenario system
mixture = mix("A" => 0.3, "B" => 0.7)
original_levels = ["A", "B", "C"]  # From the actual data column
wrapper = MixtureWithLevels(mixture, original_levels)

# Direct property access
wrapper.mixture.levels     # Access to mixture levels
wrapper.mixture.weights    # Access to mixture weights
wrapper.original_levels    # Access to original data levels
```
