   - MixedModels.jl fixed effects extraction
   - StandardizedPredictors.jl support
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Solid foundation

### üìà **Areas Needing Enhancement**

- #### 1. **API Reference (`docs/src/api.md`)**
- **Current Issues**:
  - Uses `@docs` blocks but actual docstring content is minimal
  - Manual descriptions are good but formatting is inconsistent
  - Missing performance characteristics for many functions
  - Incomplete function signatures and parameter descriptions

- **Improvement Plan**:
  - Expand actual docstrings in source code
  - Standardize function documentation format
  - Add performance notes for all functions
  - Include comprehensive examples for each API function

- #### 2. **Getting Started (`docs/src/getting_started.md`)**
- **Current Issues**:
  - Good structure but could use more specific performance numbers
  - Could have clearer progression from basic to advanced usage
  - Missing troubleshooting section
  - Limited discussion of when to use different interfaces

- **Improvement Plan**:
  - Add concrete performance benchmarks with numbers
  - Expand troubleshooting and common pitfalls section
  - Add decision tree for choosing interfaces
  - Include more "what's next" guidance

- #### 3. **Examples (`docs/src/examples.md`)**
- **Current Issues**:
  - Good content but could use more diverse real-world scenarios
  - Some examples are quite long and could be better organized
  - Missing domain-specific examples (economics, biology, etc.)
  - Could use more concise examples for quick reference

- **Improvement Plan**:
  - Add diverse domain-specific examples
  - Create "quick reference" examples section
  - Better organization with clear use case categories
  - Add performance timing results to examples

- #### 4. **Performance Guide (`docs/src/guide/performance.md`)**
- **Current Issues**:
  - Solid content but could be more actionable
  - Missing specific benchmarking methodologies
  - Could use more real-world performance patterns
  - Limited discussion of memory profiling techniques

- **Improvement Plan**:
  - Add standardized benchmarking procedures
  - Include memory profiling examples
  - Add performance debugging workflow
  - Include case studies with before/after metrics

- #### 5. **Basic Usage (`docs/src/guide/basic_usage.md`)**
- **Current Issues**:
  - Good foundation but inconsistent depth
  - Some sections are sparse while others are detailed
  - Could use better code organization
  - Missing validation examples

- **Improvement Plan**:
  - Standardize section depth and detail level
  - Add validation and debugging examples
  - Better code organization with clear sections
  - Add common workflow patterns

### üîß **Cross-Cutting Improvements Needed**

- #### 1. **Consistency Standards**
- **Issue**: Varying levels of detail and formatting across documents
- **Solution**: Establish documentation style guide based on scenarios.md quality

- #### 2. **Cross-References**
- **Issue**: Limited linking between related concepts across documents
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive internal linking and "see also" sections

- #### 3. **Code Validation**
- **Issue**: Some example code may not run correctly
- **Solution**: Implement documentation testing to validate all code examples

- #### 4. **Visual Consistency**
- **Issue**: Diagram quality and style varies across sections
- **Solution**: Standardize diagram creation and ensure consistent visual style

- **Concrete examples**: Always include runnable code with expected outputs
- **Performance metrics**: Include timing and allocation information where relevant
- **Clear sections**: Use consistent heading hierarchy and organization

### Code Examples
- **Complete and runnable**: All code should work as written
- **Performance-aware**: Show both allocating and non-allocating versions
- **Well-commented**: Explain non-obvious concepts
- **Realistic data**: Use meaningful variable names and realistic data sizes

### Technical Writing
- **Concise but complete**: Avoid redundancy while covering all important aspects (Strunk & White principles)
- **Academic accessibility**: Measured, scholarly tone that remains approachable to practitioners
- **User-focused**: Write from the user's perspective and workflow
- **Actionable**: Provide clear next steps and guidance
- **Validated**: Ensure all technical claims are accurate
- **Style guide**: Follow Strunk & White constrained by academic precision requirements

## Success Metrics
